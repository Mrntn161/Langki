This Langki template helps you quickly create Chinese vocabulary flashcards. All you need to do is enter the word you want to learn into the 'Vocab' field — the AI will handle the rest and automatically generate your flashcards.

For each word you enter, the system creates two flashcards: one for recognition practice, and another for active recall.

Each flashcard includes the definition, pinyin, example sentence, and stroke order diagram.
When practicing active recall, you can type your answer, speak it aloud, or write it by hand for better memory retention.

**By default**, the AI-generated flashcard includes: _pinyin_, _definition_, and an _example sentence_.

If you'd like to add extra information such as: pinyin for the example sentence, synonyms/antonyms, etc.,
you can [set up quick response presets](https://langki.net/vi/docs/langki_configuration/#g%E1%BB%A3i-%C3%BD-ph%E1%BA%A3n-h%E1%BB%93i) for easier lookup.

> **Note:**
> The default definition generated by AI will be in English.
> To switch to your mother language, go to the 'Card' and edit the prompt to request a definition in your language.
> Also, flashcards will only be generated when both the 'Front' and 'Back' fields are empty.

It is compatible with Anki Desktop, AnkiDroid, AnkiMobile, and AnkiWeb. However, to use the template properly on Anki Desktop, you’ll need to install [the Langki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1400986563).
