# Final words

If you're reading this blog post, thank you for sticking with the tutorial all the way to the end. In this final post, I’d like to share a bit of the philosophy behind Langki.

In an age where information is abundant and AI can generate learning material with just a few prompts,something unimaginable when I first used Anki, the way we structure and interact with learning content matters more than simply generating flashcards in bulk. Ironically, what determines the effectiveness of Anki has little to do with your review sessions, but much more to do with how you interact with the target language outside of Anki. Memorizing and cramming flashcards is never sufficient to reach fluency.

From day one, I had a clear goal in mind: to create a language tool for self-learners. No strict curriculum, no defined path, and no fixed milestones. Langki isn’t a traditional course or structured program. Instead, it's like a Swiss Army knife for language learning, flexible, modular, and designed to give learners full control over how they practice their language skills.

Langki doesn’t aim to replace non-AI learning methods or your existing workflow. It doesn’t promise that AI will give you a shortcut to fluency. It simply speeds up the feedback loop and the process of looking up information. The framework adapts to your current learning process and provides additional features I wish Anki had. Whether you’re learning through tutoring, textbooks, or traditional classrooms, Langki empowers you to actively engage with the material, rather than rely on rote memorization.

Over the past year, I’ve seen early users apply Langki in all sorts of ways. Some use it simply to build vocabulary decks, while others use it for translation practice, listening exercises, and more. Not everyone uses my pre-built templates or follows my workflow, and that’s perfectly fine. I’m still learning myself and constantly figuring out how to improve in my own target language.

If you have a cool idea for a new template or feedback to share, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m building a collection of templates and decks powered by Langki. After all, starting from scratch can be overwhelming and disorienting. Community contributions make it easier for everyone.

I hope you find this project helpful. And if you do, please consider giving it a thumbs-up on the add-on page to help more people discover it.
