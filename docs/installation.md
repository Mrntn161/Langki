# What is Langki?

Langki is a comprehensive template that builds on the core features of Anki, offering an all-in-one toolkit designed specifically for language learners. The name 'Langki' combines 'language' and 'Anki'.

## Note for Beginners

This tutorial assumes you’re already familiar with Anki; specifically how to install an add-on, import a pre-made deck, and design a template. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to create, customize, and integrate Langki into your Anki flashcards.

If you're new to Anki, I recommend going straight to [the Collection](https://langki.net/collection) to find a pre-built template or deck that suits your needs. If you don’t find what you're looking for, feel free to [contact me](https://langki.net/contact). I'm happy to create a customized template for your target language.

## Installation

To get started, install [the Langki add-on](the Langki add-on) and download [the Langki – Prototype note type](https://langki.net/collection/prototype).
