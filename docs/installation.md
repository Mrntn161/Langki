# What is Langki?

Langki is an AI-powered framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with spaced repetition systems (SRS). The framework aims to extend the basic features of Anki flashcards to offer an all-in-one toolkit for language learners. The name 'Langki' is a blend of 'language' and 'Anki'.

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with Anki, specifically, how to install an add-on, import a pre-made deck, and design a template. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to create, customize, and integrate Langki into your Anki flashcards. Alternatively, you can jump straight to [the Collection](https://langki.net/collection) to find a specific template or deck that suits your needs. If you don’t find what you're looking for, feel free to [contact me](https://langki.net/contact), I'm happy to create a customized template for your target language.

To get started, install [the Langki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1400986563) and [download the Langki – Prototype note type](https://langki.net/collection/prototype).
