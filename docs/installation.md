# What is Langki?

Langki is an AI-powered framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with spaced repetition systems (SRS). The framework aims to extend the basic features of Anki flashcards to offer an all-in-one toolkit for language learners. The name 'Langki' is a blend of 'language' and 'Anki'.

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with Anki — including how to install an add-on, import a pre-made deck, and design a template. (Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is not required.)

To get started, install the Langki add-on and download the Langki – Prototype note type.
