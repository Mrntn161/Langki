# Every time I tap to interact with the flashcard, it flips to the back side.

You need to **customize the "tap" action to flip the card** by following these steps:

1. **Open AnkiMobile** on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Open any **deck**.
3. On the review screen, tap the **gear icon ⚙️** in the top-right corner.
4. Select **"Review Settings"** or **"Settings"** (depending on your version).
5. Tap on **"Gestures"**.
6. You'll see several touch regions (e.g., **Top**, **Center**, **Bottom**, etc.).
7. For the region you want (e.g., **Center**), assign the action **"Show Answer"** or **"Flip Card"**.
8. Tap **"Done"** to save your changes.

✅ Tip: Assigning **"Show Answer"** to the center region lets you simply tap the middle of the screen to flip the card — very convenient during review.
